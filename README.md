# Description

The current structure consists of a magneto-elastic system composed of a clamped beam interacting with a permanent magnet in mono-stable configurations with hardening behavior. The experimental setup is composed of a cantilever aluminum beam with 300 mm x 19 mm x 3.2 mm. The structure has a small steel mass attached to the free end of the beam and a neodymium magnet with a 2 mm gap to the mass.

A small bolt with four masses (nuts) was placed in the middle of the beam to simulate small structural variations. Each mass has 2 grams.

The equipment, sensors, and actuators used for the experimental tests are:

  <li> Modal Shop Shaker 2004E</li>
	  <li> Polytec OFV-525/-5000-S modular laser vibrometer</li>
  <li> Dytran load cell model 1022V (IEPE force sensor)</li>
  <li> Three PCB IEPE Accelerometers</li>
  <li> m+p VibPilot acquisition system</li><br>

The shaker was attached 50 mm distant from the clamp. Velocity was measured through the laser vibrometer in the free end of the beam. Three accelerometers were placed in: the driving point, the position of the bolt and the four masses, and in the free end of the beam.

Each experiment generated a mat file with the variables recorded during the modal tests. Table 1 shows the variables included in each file with the respective description.

Four different input signals were used to characterize the baseline condition of the structure ("healthy" state): chirp, random noise, sine, and stepped sine excitation:

<li> Chirp input from 20 to 50 Hz, with 4096 samples and input levels of: 0.01, 0.09, 0.10, 0.11, 0.12, 0.13, 0.14 and 0.15 V. Each test was repeated 50 times in order to check repeatability</li>
<li>Random noise input band-pass filtered from 10 to 420 Hz, with 4096 samples and input levels of: 0.01, 0.05, 0.10, 0.11, 0.12, 0.13, 0.14 and 0.15 VRMS. Each test was repeated 50 times in order to check repeatability</li>
<li>Sine input with a frequency of 20.5 Hz, with 81920 samples and input levels of: 0.01, 0.09, 0.10, 0.11, 0.12, 0.13, 0.14 and 0.15 V</li>
<li> Stepped sine input from 10 to 40 Hz with steps of 0.5 Hz and total duration of 249856 samples using input levels of: 0.01, 0.05, 0.10, 0.11, 0.12, 0.13, 0.14 and 0.15 V</li><br>

The description of the files of these experiments is presented in Table 2. The character "0pXY" denotes Volts' input level, where "XY" represents the digits after the floating-point.

The masses were gradually removed from a total of 4 masses to simulate a structural variation. Table 3 shows the structural states simulated in the system, while the figure below exhibits a view of the bolt and nuts in the magneto-elastic system.

For the damage detection, only two signals were used to excite the nonlinear beam:

<li>Chirp input from 20 to 50 Hz, with 4096 samples and input levels of: 0.01, 0.09, 0.10, 0.11, 0.12, 0.13, 0.14 and 0.15 V. Each test was repeated 50 times in order to check repeatability</li><br>
<li>Random noise input band-pass filtered from 10 to 420 Hz, with 4096 samples and input levels of: 0.01, 0.05, 0.10, 0.11, 0.12, 0.13, 0.14 and 0.15 VRMS. Each test was repeated 50 times in order to check repeatability</li><br>

The description of the files of these experiments is presented in Table 4. The character "0pXY" denotes Volts' input level, where "XY" represents the digits after the floating-point.
