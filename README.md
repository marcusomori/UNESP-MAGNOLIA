# Description

The current structure consists of a magneto-elastic system composed by a clamped beam interacting with a permanent magnet in a mono-stable configurations with hardening behavior. The experimental setup is composed by a cantilever aluminum beam with dimensions of 300$\times$19$\times$ 3.2 mm. The structure has a small steel mass attached to the free end of the beam and a neodymium magnet with a gap of 2 mm with respect to the mass.

A small bolt with 4 masses (nuts) were placed in the middle of the beam in order to simulate small structural variations. Each mass has 2 grams.
